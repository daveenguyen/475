#C-Sharp Continued...

###Using namespace

Similar to using inheritance in Java
* using directive

EXAMPLE:
```using System;``` <== uses a name space of system
so we can use...

```Console.WriteLine("");```

instead of

```System.Console.WriteLine("");```

Namespace is very similar to C++`s namespace;

EX:

```
namespace N1
{
	class c1
	{
		class c2
		{

		} // N1.c1.c2
	} // N1.c1

	namespace N2
	{
		class c2
		{
		} // N1.N2.c2
	}
}
```

======

###Using an alias

```using Alias = System.console;```

So in our main...

```Alias.WriteLine("____");```

======

###Inheritance

Example of doing inheritance


```
public class Contact: Person
{
	// ...
}
```


Example of overwriting a base class method

```
class Person
{
	public virtual String Name {get; set;}
}

public class Contact: Person
{
	//...
	public override String Name // lets us override the original class`s function
	{
		//...
	}
}
```


Another example of overloading

```
public class Base
{
	int _x;
	public virtual int myProperty;
	{
		get
		{
			return _x;
		}
	}

	public virtual void doSomething()
	{
		_x = 13;
	}
}
```


```
public class Derived: Base
{
	public override int myProperty // Overrrides the property found in class Base
	{
		get
		{
			return _xy2;
		}
	}

	public override void doSomething()
	{
		_x = 14;
	}
}
```


So in our main...

```
Base d = new Derived();
d.doSomething();
Console.WriteLine(d.myProperty.toString());
```

**NOTE:** Can't assign a base class to a subclass!

###SUPER

Recall using 'super' in Java? Well we use base in C# instead! We use base to call the base method you override in the subclass.

Example:


```
public class A
{
	public virtual void love()
	{
		//...
	}
}
```

```
public class B: A
{
	public override void love()
	{
		base.love();
	}
}
```

======

###new Keyword

Use ```new``` to override non-virtual methods or properties

```
public class Base
{
	public virtual void doSomethingVirtual()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Base.doSomethingVirtual");
	}
	public void doSomethingNonVirtual()
	{
	Console.WriteLine("Base.doSomethingNonVirtual");
	}
}
```

Now we`ll create a derived class...

```
public class Derived: Base
{
	public override void doSomethingVirtual()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Derive.doSomethingVirtual");
	}

	// override method doSomethingVirtual()
	public new void doSomethingNonVirtual()
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Derived.doSomethingNonVirtual");
	}
}
```

In main

```
Base baseRef = new Derived();
baseRef.doSomethingVirtual(); // Displays Derive.displaySomethingVirtual
baseRef.doSomethingNonVirtual; // Won`t call Base.doSomethingNonVirtual..., the keyword needs a new operator


Derived derivedRef = new Derived();
derivedRef.doSomethingVirtual(); // Derived doSomethingVirtual
derivedRef.doSomethingNonVirtual();
```

====

#Sealed Class (cannot be derived from...)


```
public sealed class A
{
	// ...
}

public class B: A // syntax error
{
	// ...
}
```


###sealed methods

This presents a subclass from overriding a base class member that was originally declared as virtual function.

```
class A
{
	public virtual void test
	{
		//...
	}
}

class B:A
{
	public override sealed void test()
	{

	}
}

class C:B
{
	public override void test()
	{
		//... SYNTAX ERROR
	}
}
```

#Interface

```
public interface IA
{
	// ...
}
```

#Upcasting and downcasting

Think of a BankAccount, which has a CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount, and LotteryAccount (lulz)


```
BankAccount ba1, ba2 = new BankAccount();
LotteryAccount la1, la2 = new LotteryAccount();
```

```
ba1 = la2; // A-OKAY. Upcasting is no problem.
la1 = ba2; // Downcasting. ILLEGAL. Syntax error at compile time
la1 = (LotteryAccount) ba2; // ILLEGAL. Syntax error at run-time
la1 = (LotteryAccount) ba1; // A-OKAY, since ba1 was assigned to be a LotteryAccount type
```

Bottom-line?

Upcasting is A-OKAY! Downcasting? Well, it depends.

#Assembly

We are dealing here with .exe and .dll files

===

#Access Modifiers

Where to access...

public -- inside AND outside assembly in reference, basically EVERYWHERE
protected -- can only be accessed in defined class & subclass. Also in & out of assembly
private -- can only be accessed inside defined (same) class or struct
interal -- can be accessed inside same assembly, but not another
protected internal -- accepted anywhere inside same assembly and to the derived class outside of assembly

** The default class for C# is internal **

From the Microsoft website...

> **public**
>
> The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
>
> **private**
>
> The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.
>
> **protected**
>
> The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct, or in a class that is derived from that class.
>
> **internal**
>
> The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.
>
> **protected internal**
>
> The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it is declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly. Access from another assembly must take place within a class declaration that derives from the class in which the protected internal element is declared, and it must take place through an instance of the derived class type.
